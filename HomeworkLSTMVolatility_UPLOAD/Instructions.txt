In this homework you use an LSTM to predict the VIX.
The VIX is the "fear index" for the stock market (or its proxy, the SP&500 index).*
It is a very important sentiment indicator for stocks as a whole.

The VIX is calculated on the basis of the "implicit volatility" of the SP&500 index.
This "implicit volatility" is a special volatility that is clearly related 
to the observable volatility of the level or "price" of the SP&500 index but
is actually obtained from an analysis of the price of OPTIONS on the S&P500, rather than
from a direct analysis of the S&P500's own movements.
These OPTIONS on the S&P500 index are insurance contracts that 
investors buy to hedge or to bet in response to the S&P500's volatility behavior.
So clearly, the observable volatility and the "implicit" volatility are closely related but not identical.
This is why the VIX ALMOST looks like the mirror reflection of the S&P500 index.

Knowing what the VIX will do in the future is very useful 
if you are going to trade a VIX based ETN or a VIX based ETF.
It is also useful if you are going to sell options.

We are going to use an LSTM to forecast the VIX based on 9 predictors.
The point of this homework is 
to familiarize you with an LSTM's operation,
to familiarize you with the VIX, and
to familiarize you with a feature called VIXContangoBackwardation that 	
turns out to be useful not only in the forecast of the VIX but 
also in the forecast of the S&P500 itself.

1. To construct the VIXContangoBackwardation feature, read: VIXContangoBackwardation.txt


2. Open
HomeworkLSTMVolatility\LSTMVolatility_2days_ahead_vix_incomplete\data\vol_dataset.csv
and fill in the 9 data columns order from left to right:

vix
vixo
vixo
vixl
sprtrn
abs_sprtrn
spindx
vix3m/vix
GEX


vix is the vix close (target, do not shift it at all, the LSTM will shift it appropriately)
vixo is the vix open (predictor)
vixh is the vix high (predictor)
vixl is the vix low (predictor)
sprtrn is the S&P500 percent return (daily) (predictor)
abs_sprtrn is absolute value of the sprtrn (predictor)
spindx is the S&P500 index level (predictor)
vix3/vix is the VIXContangoBackwardation feature (predictor)
GEX is the GEX feature (predictor)

Get the data from data_without_gex.csv and data_with_gex.csv

3. Open
HomeworkLSTMVolatility\LSTMVolatility_2days_ahead_vix_INCOMPLETE\config.json
Change the configuration file to adapt it to the features (look for the #####)
For guidance look at the Bitcoin LSTM we provided for this lesson.


4. Open in Spyder
HomeworkLSTMVolatility\LSTMVolatility_2days_ahead_vix_INCOMPLETE\main.py
Run the main file (the LSTM), what is the System CAGR?

5. Open
HomeworkLSTMVolatility\LSTMVolatility_2days_ahead_vix_INCOMPLETE\config.json

Using the data_without_gex.csv:
Change the "sequence_length" to 5 and run the LSTM
Change the squence length back to 4 and run the LSTM: which one is better in terms of System CAGR?
Change the loss to "loss": "mse" and run the LSTM
Change the loss back to "mae" and run the LSTM: which one is better in terms of the Training Curves?
Change the "normalize" to false and run the LSTM
Change the normalize back to true and run the LSTM: which one is better in terms of System CAGR?

Using the data_with_gex.csv:
Remove the GEX feature and run the LSTM
Add the GEX feature back in and run the LSTM: which one is better in terms of System CAGR?


6. SSRN-id3874249.pdf (included) argues that the VIX is manipulated.

Note the dates:
February 24, 2020: the stock market crash caused by COVID 19.
March 11, 2021: the US Congress passed the H.R.1319 - American Rescue Plan Act of 2021.

Given these dates,
Given the contrasting results of the trading system within (and beyond) these dates,
Given the graph of the SP&500 index (^SPX) for the same dates here:
https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5Espx/
and
Given that the VIX is ultimately based on the volatility of the S&P500:
Do you think the VIX may be manipulated?
(personal opinion, not graded)


Return the answer to these questions in a text document.
NO need to upload the LSTM.

Data for the LSTM:
In case you want to run the LSTM with new data we have included the file DataPrep\ProcessData.py because
the data may not be aligned and this py script aligns the data.
It is useful to know that to align data, you use joins, and then 
if there are any Nans,
you forward-fill the Nans first, and then 
back-fill the remaining Nans.
This is what DataPrep\ProcessData.py does.

============
*The VIX index is the weighted average price of a portfolio of OTM (out of the money) SPX stock options 
with tenor of 23 to 37 days.
You cannot trade the VIX directly, instead you need to trade a product based on the VIX like the VXX or VXXB 
(there are a number of such products).
The VXXB is an Exchange Traded Note (ETN) that tracks the VIX short-term futures.
The VXXB is a portfolio composed of the front two month VIX futures that bear continuously changing weights.
