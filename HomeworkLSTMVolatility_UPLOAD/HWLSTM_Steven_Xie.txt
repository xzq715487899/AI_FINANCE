Using the data_without_gex.csv:
Change the "sequence_length" to 5 and run the LSTM
System CAGR: -90.3%
System Sharpe: -1.4
Market CAGR: 4.5%
Market Sharpe: 0.0

Change the squence length back to 4 and run the LSTM: which one is better in terms of System CAGR?
System CAGR: -88.6%
System Sharpe: -1.3
Market CAGR: 6.3%
Market Sharpe: 0.0

Sequence length 4 is better in terms of System CAGR.


Change the loss to "loss": "mse" and run the LSTM
System CAGR: -87.7%
System Sharpe: -1.3
Market CAGR: 6.3%
Market Sharpe: 0.0

Change the loss back to "mae" and run the LSTM: which one is better in terms of the Training Curves?
System CAGR: -89.3%
System Sharpe: -1.4
Market CAGR: 6.3%
Market Sharpe: 0.0

mae is better in terms of the training curves with aorund loss around 7.5, mse loss is around 6000

Change the "normalize" to false and run the LSTM
System CAGR: -42.1%
System Sharpe: -0.4
Market CAGR: 6.3%
Market Sharpe: 0.0
Change the normalize back to true and run the LSTM: which one is better in terms of System CAGR?
System CAGR: -88.6%
System Sharpe: -1.3
Market CAGR: 6.3%
Market Sharpe: 0.0

"normalize" to false is better in terms of System CAGR

Using the data_with_gex.csv:
Remove the GEX feature and run the LSTM
System CAGR: -89.5%
System Sharpe: -1.4
Market CAGR: 5.7%
Market Sharpe: 0.0
Add the GEX feature back in and run the LSTM: which one is better in terms of System CAGR?
System CAGR: -88.8%
System Sharpe: -1.3
Market CAGR: 5.7%
Market Sharpe: 0.0

With added GEX feature back, the model is better in terms of System CAGR

6.Given that the VIX is ultimately based on the volatility of the S&P500:
Do you think the VIX may be manipulated?
I would say VIX is not manipulated because it is consistant with the S&P500 market behavior. VIX is great in terms of 
risk hedging without adding leverage like buying or selling options.
