Borrowing an idea from https://archive.md/4690U, where
the VIX3M used to be called VXV:

Construct the ContangoBackwardation feature 
by calculating the ratio: VIX3M/VIX (or alternatively, the ratio VIX6M/VIX) 

VIX3M: 3 month tenor SP500 index options, VIX6M_History_CBOE.csv
VIX6M: 6 month tenor SP500 index options, VIX3M_History_CBOE.csv
VIX: 1 month tenor (approx) SP500 index options, VIX_History_CBOE.csv

The data is from the CBOE:

The ratio VIX3M/VIX (VIX6M/VIX) measures:
the slope of the term structure curve of the VIX futures contracts

You can see the term structure of the VIX futures contracts here:
http://vixcentral.com/
All commodities traded with futures contracts have a similar term structure curve.
It should remind you of the yield curve and plays a similar role.

A value of VIX3M/VIX above 1 indicates "contango."
Contango is the name for the normal positive slope of the term structure curve.

A value of the ratio below 1 indicates "backwardation."
Backwardation is the abnormal (and short-lived), negative slope.

Our VIX3M/VIX is a shortcut for the more accurate ContangoBackwardation indicator  
using the relation between vx.1 (1 month tenor) and vx.2 (2 month tenor) that
you can calculate using data from here: 
https://www.cboe.com/us/futures/market_statistics/historical_data/
This is a rather complicated task, so we prefer the shortcut version.

VIX3M/VIX < 1 ("backwardation") means potential "trouble ahead" for the S&P500 index.
You can see in VIXContangoBackwardation.xlsx how 
S&P500 crashes are usually shortly preceded or accompanied by VIX3M/VIX < 1.
However,  crash signal does not always work: 
the presence of our VIX3M/VIX < 1 is no guarantee of a coming crash.
In any case, keep in mind that our VIX3M/VIX 
is actually a shortcut, as we mentioned above.

Note:
for the VIX futures,  "contango/backwardation" is "upwardly/downwardly sloping" and "contango/upwardly sloping" is normal.
for commodities futures, "contango/backwardation" is "upwardly/downwardly sloping." and "backwardation/downwardly sloping" is normal because
normally, a useful consummable commodity has a balanced supply relative to demand and
it makes sense to sell the commodity now rather than to store it and sell it in the future.

The following occurs as an exception:
For the VIX, backwardation (downwardly sloping) is considered a bearish (pesimistic) sign for the underlying SP500 index because
the market expects that the price of the SP500 will lower (with increased volatility) soon, and
participants are willing to pay a premium for SP500 volatility protection right now.
For a commodity, contango (upwardly sloping) is considered a bearish (pesimistic) sign for the markets because
it occurs whenever a commodity has too much supply now relative to demand.
In that case, it makes sense to store the commodity now and sell it in the future.
